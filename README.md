CS-230 The Gaming Room
Operating Platforms


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client,Gaming Room, has a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that has been a success on the android platform but the client would like to expand to other operating systems and platforms. The client is interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe the best work i did in the documentation was in the recommendation section where i outlined all the key areas of the operating system that benefitted the client. For the clients needs i recommennded Windows and gave detailed information for the client's consideration which inclued the architecture of Windows, the different storaga management solutions within the operating system, the different levels of security, how we could implememnt our clients server distribution system and finally memoory management.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Analyzing the UML diagram within the domain model proved extremely beneficial in developing the code. The UML depicted the attributes, structures, behaviors and relationships that the classes would inherit from Entity. With the use of the UML i was able to develop the Class identities, instance variables, contructors, and methods. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The evaluation section where we compared the different development requirements needed for each of the Operating Systems(Mac, Linux, Windows, Mobile). 

I would have included more details into how each of the tools directly and indirectly affect the clients needs. I filled out the evaluation section by doing a compare and contrast of the Operating Systems to each other. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The clients priamry needs while developing an application are esssential in developing a working relationship with them. For this project the clients needs and my focus were that the gaming app, Love It or Lose It worked on multiple platforms while being fast, reliable, secure while containing the neccessary resources in the storage and memory department. We did not get into the GUI of the game application but that would also be of high improtance to both the client and the end user because the GUI determines how much activity the user takes in the game, which means the client makes more money and us the developer created a game that met all of the clients goals which will open the door to future business and customers.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

What i've learned throughout this process is that, depending on the clients needs, serverless cloud based systems are a great tool when developing. Cloud based systems offer backend services on a when needed basis, they offer scalabilitym and flexibility and the cost of running, maintaining and operating a server is not the responsibility of the client or developer. When i approached the software i first looked at it as traditioanl coding methods but the further we got along, the more i was able to understadn the different concepts needed that were needed to achieve the clients goals. I improved on project development skills, creativitym problem solving skills, desgin principles and finally followed the programming rules.
